## Annotations for functions

* torch.randperm(n): Creates a random permutation/rearrangement of the integers from 0 to n-1; e.g. [0, 3, 1, 2, 4] for n=5

## 7.9 Break It Deliberately

Try these one at a time:

- remove `p.grad.zero_()` in `train.py`
    * Euh, idk, I only saw my training AND test loss getting smaller which can only be a good thing...?
    * CORRECT ANSWER: Without grads/computational cleanups, gradients will accumulate across epochs, so you accidentally created a weird growing-step optimizer. On this tiny convex linear problem, that can look like “faster learning.” But it is unstable and not the intended SGD update.

- set `lr=5.0` in `experiments.ipynb` (was 0.05)
    * Wow, my training AND test loss got EVEN smaller than after getting rid of `p.grad.zero_()`!
    * I feel like this is because my layer is simple (just linear with simple convexity), and conversely, I feel like bigger lr may lead it to overfit.
    * CORRECT ANSWER: Large LR can speed convergence, but it can also overshoot or diverge. It is an optimization stability issue, not directly an overfitting issue. If lr=5.0 worked better, then it might be 1) original lr=0.05 being too slow, 2) the problem is simple/convex, 3) got lucky with initialization/data, 4) accidentally continued training from already-trained weights, 5) the run has not gone long enough to show instability

- set `noise_std=5.0` in `data.py` (was 0.1)
    * Hmm, my loss actually got larger, which means that this simple linear model learned part of the noise, when it was supposd to only focus on improving `w` and `b`.
    * CORRECT ANSWER: Higher label noise raises the minimum possible loss. With enough data, the model should learn the signal while noise averages out. With little data, the noise can distort the learned weights.
    
- use only 10 training examples (change `train_fraction` in `data.py` from 0.8 to 0.05 given `make_regression_data(200, 6)`)
    * Yup, training AND test loss got bigger because there is less data
    * Interestingly, test loss can be smaller than training loss, but this is just because the model is poorly underfit
    * CORRECT ANSWER: Less data increases estimation error and generalization variance. Test loss being smaller than train loss does not automatically mean underfitting. It can simply mean the tiny training set was noisier/harder than the test set. Given that

- evaluate on training data only (change `test_loss`' X and y dataset to training on `experiments.ipynb`)
    * Test loss just became the same to training loss whereas it should have been slightly bigger
    * CORRECT ANSWER: This destroys the generalization check. The number may look good, but it no longer measures unseen-data performance.

Write what happens in `notes.md`.

# 7.10 Checkpoint

You are ready to move on only when you can answer:

* What is the shape of X?
    * (200, 6) give X, y, true_w, true_b = make_regression_data(200, 6)

* What is the shape of w?
    * (6,) given w = torch.randn(6, requires_grad=True)

* Why must the loss be scalar before calling backward()?
    * Because we need to make sure the loss is fully derived before passing it back to the params
    * CORRECT ANSWER: A scalar loss gives PyTorch one objective to differentiate. If loss is a vector of per-example losses, PyTorch does not know what weighted combination of those losses I want gradients for unless I reduce it with mean/sum or explicitly provide gradient weights.

* Why do gradients need to be cleared?
    * Because PyTorch does not clear gradients on its own, and accumulating gradients create an evergrowing-step optimizer that could distort gradients.
    * CORRECT ANSWER: PyTorch accumulates gradients by default. If I do not clear them, each update uses old gradients plus new gradients, creating an unintended update rule.

* How do train loss and test loss differ?
    * Train loss focuses on loss versus the training dataset, and test loss compares against un-trained dataset (or how well the model generalizes vs memorizes).
    * CORRECT ANSWER: Train loss measures fit on data used for parameter updates. Test loss measures performance on data not used for updates, so it estimates generalization. Avoid “memorizes” for this tiny linear model unless you are specifically talking about overfitting. Linear regression can overfit, but here the main concept is generalization.

* What does it mean if w is close to true_w?
    * That the loss is very small and congratulations!
    * CORRECT ANSWER: It means the model recovered the hidden linear rule used to generate the synthetic labels. The learned parameters are close to the ground-truth parameters. Loss should be small too, but w close to true_w is specifically evidence that the learned rule matches the data-generating rule.
